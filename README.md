# Raspberry-Pi-GPIO
Learning to code with Raspberry Pi and Python.

This is a very simple project that uses the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.
I created some simple code(it contains global variables! Sorry) to flash a series of LEDs. 
The idea is that you have to remember the order in which the LEDs are flashed and then reproduce that with the
buttons. The number of flashes is incremented by one after every successful entry.

This was coded and built using a Raspberry Pi model B.
You will need 4 leds, 4 ressitors 270ohms, 4 resistors 10000ohms, 4 push buttons and jumper wires. To use the code you need to wire up four LEDs and four switches(check online for those tutorials). Once wired up you can run this code to get them flashing. See how many flashes you can remember. The does work, but can be improved in many ways! The global variables need removing, it needs a way of saving the highscore and could do with a nice user interface.
