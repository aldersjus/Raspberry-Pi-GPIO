# Raspberry-Pi-GPIO
Learning to code with Raspberry Pi and Python.

This is a very simple project that uses the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.
I created some simple code(it contains global variables! Sorry) to flash a series of LEDs. 
The idea is you have to remember the order in which the LEDs are flashed and then reproduce that with the
buttons. The number of flashes is incremented by one after every successful entry.
